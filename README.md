# Breaking Bad Cast

Built this react project based on one of my favourite shows of all time Breaking Bad.

Check out the project [here](https://rathod-shubham.github.io/BreakingBadCast/).\
Basically we are going to fetch data making http request and display the results.

## Getting Started :

Create a react project using react create-app.

Install Axios.

Run the application locally on local host:3000

## Using this repo:

git clone or download the zip file.

Install the package and any packages that it depends on `npm install`

run the app `npm start`

## API

You can learn more about the [Breaking Bad Api](https://breakingbadapi.com/documentation).

### `npx create-react-app breakingbad`

Getting Started with Create React App

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.


### `npm i axios`
Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js.\
Basically axios is a HTTP library used to make request.
